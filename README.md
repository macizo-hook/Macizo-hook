## What Sort of Engineer is Tony?

I'm a seasoned (heavy on the garlic) "SRE", who enjoys solving complex problems in systems ,distributed or otherwise. I also dig it when these complex systems fail, and digging through the data attainable from such failures. These days, I am gravitating towards contributing to technologies that offer the following abstract potentials:

* 🤘🏽 Tech that brings small groups of people together to cherish common interests. 
* 🏦 Tech that decentralizes traditional finance. 
* 🍎 Tech that facilitates knowledge-building, and educational equity. 
* 🌍 Tech that enables the exploration of our planet.
* 🌽 Tech that optimizes agricultural output, and promotes sustainable practices. 
* 🧘🏼‍♀️ Tech that calms us down. (Mindfulness)
